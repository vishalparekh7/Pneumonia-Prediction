# Pneumonia-Prediction_SmartInternz


Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among youngchildren  and  one  of  the  top  mortality  causes  worldwide.The pneumonia detection is usually performed through ex-amine of chest X-ray radiograph by highly-trained special-ists.  This process is tedious and often leads to a disagree-ment between radiologists.  Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we develop the computational approach for pneumonia regions detection based on deep  convolution  neural  net-works,  augmentations  and  multi-task  learning.

Dataset Taken From Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

To run the project, perform the following steps in order : -

(1) Download the dataset from above link and extract to a folder.

(2) According to the directory of the extracted files modify the paths in train.ipynb and predict.ipynb files.        

## Without Interface : 

(1) Run train.ipynb file using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

(2) A model will be saved with extension filename.h5.

(2) After the model is saved, run the predict.ipynb using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

## With Interface  :

(1) Run train.ipynb file using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

(2) A model will be saved with extension filename.h5.

(3) Move that .h5 into spyder/models folder.

(4) Now open command prompt and move to your spyder directory.

(5) Run the app.py file using command python app.py in command prompt.

(6) A url will appear (similar to this '127.0.0.1:5000/') in the command prompt.

(7) Copy that url and paste it in the web browser.

(8) Voila! You are done :).
